<h3>PICKING MY TOPIC</h3>

For my project, I chose the topic of astrophysics because I have been attracted to it for many years now. Before setting my opinion on the topic I chose, two other topics that are somewhat similar to astrophysics and has aroused in my mind which were: aero dynamics and astrobiology. Two websites that drove me to be attracted to these topics were (https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/learn-about-aerodynamics/) and (https://astrobiology.com/) because they gave me info, ideas and even formats for my website. But the most attention-grabbing website for me was (https://www.space.com/26218-astrophysics.html) because it explains what astrophysics are and explains it very clearly too. As I was reading, I figured that since astrophysics are cool to me, why not share the love I have for it and spread information and have kids love it growing up like me when I was growing up. Many people think it's useless, but to me, I think that its important that we know this because it could also branch off and teach you about the other topics I was going to do this project on. Lastly, it teaches us about the physics and how things work in our universe, so why would you not want to learn about it?

<h3>DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
I am still on the beginning stage of my website design. Which is picking and processing my topic and figure ou the path I want my project to go into. I want my website to highlight the importance of knowing these topics and the interesting parts about space and it's study. I want people to look at my website and let them come to realize how cool space really is. It could really be an eye opener too because some people don't even know what it is and its important to know the universe in which you live. My website will inform the browser on what astrophysics are why it's important that we know how our universe works so that we can set up radars and create informative techincal inventions. The design will be easy to manuever around and will be very informative as well as being interesting.

<h3>PROS AND CONS</h3>

##### PROS
There are many Pros to learning about this topic. Some of them are:
* You can understand the scientific definition of life.
* It also has driven many technical advances like telescopes, satellites, detectors, and data analysis.
* It could teach us about upcoming life that may be a threat or a ally. 

##### CONS
With pros, there are bound to be cons and they are:
* It may be hard to grab.
* It could take a lot of time to study.
* It may be boring to some audiences.

 <h3>SKILLS</h3>
 
 I have picked up many skills since i've started to work on this project that I am grateful for because it has taught me manage my files and time. Managing my files saves so much time for big projects like these because I dont have to search for things for too long. I also have learned that **_sep is all around us_** and that we can hone our skills in sep anywhere. Another skill I have gained is important it is to be on time. If your not on time in this class, you could miss key elements and notes that can be crucial to your developnent. Lastly, I have learn to pour more heart into my work and to always perform at my greastest intelligence so that people will see my work and get a lot from it.

 <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

 **Overall**, I am looking forward to pouring my heart into this project and get people to love astrophysics as much as I do. I want to also pave the way for young learners and want to give them a reliable website to come to for information and for a ouline for their freedom project.
